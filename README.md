# Round_Robin
One of the main functions of the operation system is to schedule processes that  the processor executes. One of the very popular algorithms for this scheduling  is called Round Robin, where each process enters a queue, executes in a FIFO  order, and after a specified time its execution stops and returns back at the end  of the queue if it still need time to continue execution or aborts if it has finished  its required time of execution.  A file be given containing the name of the processes that needs execution, time slot that it will enter the queue, and the needed time for it's execution.
